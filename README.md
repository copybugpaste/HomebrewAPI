# Basics
Before you start implementing your own gadget, take your time to view some of the examples already in-game, as they're a great starting point for gadgets. 
You'll notice that the lua scripts in Homebrew look a little bit different then regular lua scripts, 

most importantly, they all follow very strict coding rules. [See Examples](Examples/Flashlight.lua)


We've also worked up a simple example on how you go about creating a custom Gadget, See [Tutorial](GadgetTutorial.md)
